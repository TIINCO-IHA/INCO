This report concerns the implementation of a cyclic code encoder and a Meggitt decoder. 

The concepts of information theory and coding are briefly introduced followed by an addressing of the theory as well as providing examples of encoding and decoding. 

A case study implementing a cyclic code encoder that can encode a message vector into systematic code a Meggitt decoder that can decode cyclic codes based on the Meggitt algorithm, detect errors and correct 2 or less errors as well as a main function enabling introduction of errors and error locations has been conducted. 

The project has been successfull in implementing both the encoder, the Meggitt decoder and the main function combining these.
