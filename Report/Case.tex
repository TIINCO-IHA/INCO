\subsection{Case Study}
This case study concerns the implementation of a Meggitt decoder which has been implemented in Matlab. 

\noindent The Meggitt decoder is implemented as a function that can decode cyclic codes based on the Meggitt algorithm. Besides the Meggitt decoder function the Matlab codes consist of two other functions: a cyclic code encoder, and a main function.

\noindent The cyclic code encoder encodes a message vector into systematic code. The main function generates a message vector and then uses the cyclic code encoder to encode the message vector. It then transmits the code vector through an artificial communication channel and hereby introduces errors to the code vector. Finally it uses the Meggitt decoder to decode the received vector. 

\noindent The conditions given for the case study are: 
\begin{itemize} \itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item Code length: 15
\item Message length: 7
\item Generator polynomial: $g(X)=1+X^4+X^6+X^7+X^8$
\end{itemize} 

\noindent All three functions are described in detail in the following. 


\subsection{Implementation of Encoder}
\label{sec:ImplementEncoder}
The implemented encoder is a Matlab function, $cyclicEncoder$. The encoder is able to encode a message vector into systematic code by receiving a generator polynomial $g$ and a message vector $m$. In addition the encoder has been made generic so that it also is possible to state the code length $n$ and the message length $k$ - if nothing is stated, the default value of n is 15 and k is 7. The output of the function is a code vector, $c$. 

\noindent Initially the function converts the message polynomial in vector form into a vector of the length n by shifting it $n-k$ to the right and thereby forming the polynomial $X^{n-k}m(X)$. 

\noindent Secondly, the now right-shifted message polynomial is divided by the generator polynomial to find the remainder polynomial, $p(X)$.

\noindent Finally, adding the right-shifted message polynomial and the remainder polynomial results in the code polynomial.  

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Cyclic Encoder, style=Code-Matlab, label=lst:refID]
 % cyclicEncoding is a function that encodes a message vector into systematic code given the following parameters
 % g is the generator polynomial in vector form
 % m is message vector
 % n is the code length
 % k is the message length
 function c = cyclicEncoding(g,m,n,k)

 % Form the polynomial X^(n-k)*m(X) by right-shifting m n-k times 
 shifted_m = [zeros(1,n-k) m];

 % Find the remainder, p, by dividing shifted_m by g over GF(2) (q is a factor)
 [q, p] = gfdeconv(shifted_m,g,2);

 % Extend p with zeros to having the length of n (to be able to add p with shifted_m)
 p = [p zeros(1, n-length(p))];

 % Obtain the code vector c by using binary addition to add shifted_m and p 
 c = mod(shifted_m+p,2);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Implementation of Meggitt decoder}
\label{sec:ImplementMeggittDecoder}
The Meggitt decoder is able to decode an input message, $r(X)$, which may contain 1 or 2 error and return the correct output vector, $v(X)$.
If $r(X)$ contains 3 error it the decoder should be able to detect error but not able to correct it.

When calling the Meggitt decoder is start with calculate the error pattern as in section \ref{sec:MeggittDedocerMaterial} matrix \ref{lst:ErrorPattern} and finding the corresponding syndromes matrix \ref{lst:syndromeErrorPattern}.
In Matlab this is done with the function in \codeTitle \ref{lst:ErrorPatternCreate}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Error pattern creation, style=Code-Matlab, label=lst:ErrorPatternCreate]
 function syndromes_errorpattern = generateErrorPattern(g,n,k)
 % generate syndrome error pattern
 
 errorpattern = fliplr(eye(n));
 errorpattern(:,n) = 1;
 syndromes_errorpattern = zeros(n,n-k);
 
 for i = 1:n
     [q, s] = gfdeconv(errorpattern(i,:), g, 2);
     if(length(s) ~= n-k)
         syndromes_errorpattern(i,:) = [s zeros(1,n-k-length(s))];
     else
         syndromes_errorpattern(i,:) = s;
     end
 end
\end{lstlisting}

The initiation of the syndrome register is happening next.
As it was shown in \fxnote{HENVISNING TIL AFSNIT MEGGITT DECODER} the initialization of the syndrome register is the same at making a polynomial division of $S(X)$ and $g(X)$.
With this knowledge the function in MatLab is as shown in \codeTitle \ref{lst:SyndromeInit}.
If the syndrome vector is less than $k$, when it don't have any bit in the high end, the syndrome is filled up with zeros so they all have a length of $k$.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Syndrome initialization, style=Code-Matlab, label=lst:SyndromeInit]
 function iSyndrome = init_Syndrome(r,g,n,k)
 % function iSyndrome = init_Syndrome(r,g,n,k)
 
 [q, iSyndrome] = gfdeconv(r,g,2);
 
 if(length(iSyndrome) ~= n-k)
     iSyndrome = [iSyndrome zeros(1,n-k-length(iSyndrome))];
 end
\end{lstlisting}

The Meggitt decoder is now ready to decode which is happening in \codeTitle \ref{lst:ErrorDetection}.
Start to check for whether the syndrome has an error or not, by checking the syndrome with all the syndromes in the $syndrome\_errorpattern$.
If it has an error the end bit in the buffer, here $r$, is corrected before it is shifted.
After the shift a new syndrome is calculated and make sure the length is $k$.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Error detection, style=Code-Matlab, label=lst:ErrorDetection]
 for i = 1:n
     % Test of syndrome is equal to one of the error syndromes
     for b = 1:n
         % Check if the calculated syndrome is equal to one of the rows in syndrome
         % table
         if(isequal(si, syndromes_errorpattern(b,:))==1)
             % correct bit, if error happened
             error_vec(i) = 1;
             r(end) = mod(r(end)+1,2);
         end
     end
     
     % Right shift the received vector 1 bit
     ri = circshift(r, [1 1]);
     % Calculate new syndrome register
     [q, si] = gfdeconv(ri,g,2);
     % Set r to ri (make the shift in memory too)
     r = ri;
     % zeropad si to compare with the syndrome table
     if(length(si) ~= n-k)
         si = [si zeros(1,n-k-length(si))];
     end
 end
\end{lstlisting}

After the decoding it sum up all information to create the tag and return the error vector and the code vector.
This MatLab code is shown in \codeTitle \ref{lst:DecodeReturn}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Meggitt decode return, style=Code-Matlab, label=lst:DecodeReturn]
 if sum(si)~=0 && sum(error_vec) > 2
     tag = 'The received vector contains more than 2 errors';
 elseif sum(si)==0 && sum(error_vec) <= 2 && sum(error_vec) >= 1
     tag = ['The decoder has corrected ', num2str(sum(error_vec)), ' error(s)'];
 else
     tag = 'The received vector contains more than 2 errors';
 end
 
 error_vec = fliplr(error_vec);
 code_vec = r;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Implementation of Main Function}
The main function generates a message vector, encodes it into a code vector, transmits it and hereby introduces errors in the code vector, and finally decodes the code vector using Meggitt decoding.

\noindent The main function makes use of the generic cyclic encoder section \ref{sec:ImplementEncoder} and the Meggitt decoder section \ref{sec:ImplementMeggittDecoder}. It is possible to decide how many errors, $t$, should be introduced during transmission, as well as it is possible to manually introduce the error location(s). The errors information send as parameters are handled by the code in \codeTitle \ref{lst:errorHandling}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Error handling, style=Code-Matlab, label=lst:errorHandling]
 if(nargin < 1)  % no input parameters
     t = 2;
     errorlocation = sort(randi(n,1,t));
 elseif(nargin > 0)
     t = t_errors;
     if(nargin < 2)
         errorlocation = sort(randi(n,1,t));
     else
         errorlocation = sort(errorloc);
     end
 end
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Initially the code length, the message length and the generator polynomial are set. A message vector is generated and by the cyclic encoder encoded into a code vector. 

\noindent Secondly, the number of errors to be introduced are stated and random error location(s) are generated. The code vector is put into the received vector and the bits at the error location(s) in the received vector are flipped. This is shown in \codeTitle \ref{lst:GenerateVector}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Generating vector, style=Code-Matlab, label=lst:GenerateVector]
 % Generate a message vector by using random numbers in GF(2))
 m = mod(randi(2,1,k),2);

 % Encode the message vector by the cyclic code encoder function
 c = cyclicEncoding(g,m,n,k);

 while(t > 2 && length(unique(errorlocation)) ~= t)
     errorlocation = sort(randi(n,1,t));
     disp('Errorlocation was recalculated!');
 end
 r = c;

 % Flip bit at generated error location i the received vector.
 % Add 1 and modulo 2 for binary addition
 r(errorlocation) = mod(c(errorlocation)+1,2);
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent After calling the Meggit decoder the main print out the different result in the commander prompt and returning the test whether the send message is equal with the decoded message.
