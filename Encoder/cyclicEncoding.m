% cyclicEncoding is a function that encodes a message vector into systematic code given the following parameters
% g is the generator polynomial in vector form
% m is message vector
% n is the code length. Default 15.
% k is the message length. Default 7.

    k = 7;
end

    shifted_m = [zeros(1,n-k) m];

    % Find the remainder, p, by dividing shifted_m by g over GF(2) (q is a factor)
    [q, p] = gfdeconv(shifted_m,g,2);

    % Extend p with zeros to having the length of n (to be able to add p with shifted_m)
    p = [p zeros(1, n-length(p))];
